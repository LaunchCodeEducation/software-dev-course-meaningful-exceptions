Take a moment to think about what you’ve learned regarding throwing and catching exceptions.
Reflect on the following questions to deepen your understanding and connect it to your development as a programmer:

  - Throwing Exceptions: How has learning to throw exceptions with descriptive messages changed the way you think
  about error handling? Why is it important to include clear and specific messages in the exceptions you throw?

  - Catching Exceptions: In your own words, explain the value of catching exceptions only when meaningful actions
  can be taken. Can you think of a situation where catching an exception indiscriminately might lead to problems
  or confusion in your code?

  - Practical Applications: How might these techniques improve the user experience or the maintainability of your code in a real-world application? Can you recall a recent coding project where throwing or selectively catching
  exceptions might have been useful?

  - Challenges and Growth: What challenges did you face when learning to throw and catch exceptions meaningfully?
  How did you overcome them, and what strategies might you use in the future to improve your error-handling skills?

Write down your thoughts and be prepared to share one key insight or takeaway with your peers. This reflection will help you reinforce your learning and identify areas for growth as you continue your coding journey.
